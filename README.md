# TA Github Repository for COSMOS Cluster 6, 2023
Contains R and Python Jupyter notebooks to walk you through various bioinformatics exercises.

# Intro to Python, pandas, and iPython notebooks
## iPython notebooks
Welcome to jupyter notebook on HPC (high-performance compute cluster). iPython notebooks / jupyter notebooks are interactive multimedia environments to write and run code.

Here is the link: [https://hpc3.rcic.uci.edu/biojhub3/](https://hpc3.rcic.uci.edu/biojhub3/). Please choose the "containerized notebook image" named "Centos7 Base Jupyter w/R4.1.2 + COSMOS 2023".

For those who have programmed and run their own programs before, perhaps you're more familiar with running your program once from start to end. iPython notebooks provide a way to run code more interactively.

Each unit in a jupyter notebook is called a cell. Typically when I use ipynbs, I run one cell at a time. You can run a cell by clicking on it and pressing shift+enter.

Copy this code into a cell and try running it:


# Cloning this Github repository
1. Log on to HPC using Terminal (Mac) or MobaXterm (Windows). See [TA slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XkhM_1Z9dsAPPeg31nrXUsKbAKWJ-iHeLLOzTKuuAdw/edit#slide=id.g257914d541e_0_174) for a walkthrough, and message us on the [help channel](https://cosmoscluster62023.slack.com/archives/C05FS0M03PH) on Slack for help!
2. Run the following line: `git clone https://github.com/erebboah/ta-github.git`
3. Type `ls` to list the contents of your home directory on HPC. You should see a new directory called “ta-github”
4. Refresh your jupyter file browser to also see "ta-github". You can navigate into the directory and explore the other notebooks and data using HPC's jupyter environment.
